# TODO
- `logo.svg` font problem: the original font used for logo in `logo.svg` was "Yu Gothic". Sadly,
I can't include it in the project. I'm trying different fonts Like "Hiragino Sans". I also
tried to get "Yasashisa Gothic" - ``*.ttf` was in the `/_site/assets/font`. I added `@font-family`
in `/css/0-tools/fonts.scss` and did testing, but no characters where showing up, so I decided to
figure out different approach. The worst case scenario is leaving the `*.png` file as a logo.
